# Collection, Management, and Analysis of Twitter Data: Using the Twitter API for Academic Research and BERT

📍 virtual MZES, Mannheim

📆 May 04, 2022

As a highly relevant platform for political as well as social online interactions, social scientists increasingly analyze Twitter data. As of 01/2021, Twitter renewed its API, which now includes access to the full history of tweets for academic usage. In this talk, I will first present a detailed walkthrough of the data collection process, from applying to access to storing the data. Following a brief discussion of data processing routines,  I then introduce an application from my own methodological research that uses textual contents of tweets from German members of parliament. It combines the state-of-the-art NLP method BERT with hierarchical shrinkage estimators to obtain legislator-level salience and position metrics for specific policy domains and sub-domains.
